# PAMM
change PAMM code for our scaling problem

PAMM means probabilistic analysis of molecular motifs (PAMM) algorithm, which made good result in hydrogen bond recognization.
In this project, I wanna change their old PAMM code (2014) to help us clustering fa-water system.

As a newbie of ML and programming, changing PAMM is such a huge work that I have to pay a lot of time in it. In order not to forget what I have done ,I will use github as my programming diary.I hope writing my PD could help me programming more cautious.
